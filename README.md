# Challenge 1: Horiseon Marketing

## Description

With this week's lesson I have had a hard time figuring out which classes in HTML were mathcing up in the selectors in CSS. When I started working on this project, I knew that I wanted to gain an understanding about class atributes so I could style my webpage and have it accesible to the users. As I was working with the CSS and HTML.index side by side I was able to find bugs that needed fixing. In section "search-engine-optimaztion" I noticed that it was missing an id so that the link can send the user to the correct spot on the page to learn about search-engine-optimaztion. I also had a hard time figuring out why my links moved from the right side of the header to the left side under the title of the company. I later noticed that a class selector didn't have the same name as the class atribute. I had a fun time figuring out which semantic tags I needed to use to replace the div tags to make the website accesible to the users, and it helped me understand how to form the page.

## User Story

* AS A marketing agency
* I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
* SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
